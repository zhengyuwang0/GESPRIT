# Fig1.m
shows the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the ESPRIT varies with n.
# Fig2.m
shows the pectral norm versus the array length N.
# Fig3.m
compares the results of three estimators with the true angles, as well as the MSE and VAR of GESPRIT and traditional ESPRIT. By varying the parameter values, the cases of widely, closely, and uncorrelated sources are investigated.
# Fig4.m
compares the MSE of ESPRIT, GESPRIT, and MUSIC methods.
